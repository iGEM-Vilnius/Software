# Molecular dynamics scripts

This directory contains molecular dynamics bundle with .mdp files and Perl scripts that can 
be used for molecular dynamics simulations.

## Prerequisites
Download and install [Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html).  
Install [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html).

DSSP (for coarse-grained molecular dynamics) that can be downloaded using 
`download_dssp.sh`, thus it would be saved in the required location for the 
`protein_CG_MD.pl` script. Then follow `dssp` installation instructions that are specified in the 
README.md file of the [repository](https://github.com/cmbi/dssp). 

## Atomic simulations
The files required for atomic molecular dynamics simulations can be found in `atomic` folder. 
It contains 4 Perl scripts to run simulations and .mdp files that contain parameters for MD
simulations.

### copy_dir.pl
A script that copies the directory that has required .mdp files and Perl scripts for molecular 
dynamics simulations.

The command to use:  
`perl copy_dir.pl [path_to_new_directory]`

### generate_system_gro.pl
A script that runs needed GROMACS commands to get the number of atoms in the gro system.
The system is the one that has a protein solvated in the solution determined by ions.mdp file.

The command to use:  
`perl generate_system_gro.pl [path_to_protein_file]`

### protein_md.pl
A script that runs needed GROMACS molecular dynamics of the protein.

The command to use:  
`perl protein_md.pl [path_to_protein_file]`

### clean.pl
A script that cleans the working directory from all files that were generated by GROMACS MD workflow.  

The command to use:  
`perl clean.pl`

## Coarse-grained simulations
The files required for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations can be found in 
`CG` folder. This folder contains `protein_CG_MD.pl` script that uses
[`martinize.py`](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/tools2/proteins-and-bilayers/204-martinize)
script adjusted for Python3, `water.gro` file (downloaded from [link](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/downloads/example-applications/63-pure-water-solvent) in
MARTINI 2 [Protein tutorial](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/tutorials-general-introduction-gmx5/proteins-gmx5) 
page) and .mdp files: `em.mdp`, `md.mdp` were taken from the folder `atomic` that
is devoted for atomic molecular dynamics simulations and `eq.mdp` was taken from the worked
files [archyve](http://cgmartini.nl/images/stories/tutorial/2017/protein-tutorial-v2016.3/soluble-protein/ubiquitin.tgz)
that can be found in the tutorial link.

### protein_CG_MD.pl
A script that runs coarse-grained molecular dynamics workflow.  

The command to use:
`perl protein_CG_MD.pl [path_to_protein_file]`
